# MessagingApp
Real-time Chat application using Node.js and the library Socket.io (an API to the WebSocket API)

The idea is for this simple chatroom to allow users to communicate with other connected users. Any number of users can connect to the chatroom and the messages one user sends becomes vidible to all users in the chatroom.

Features:
- Set username
- Change username
- send messages
- See when a user is typing
